# AI_Portfolio_Optimization

#Overview
This project implements an AI-Driven Portfolio Optimization model designed to maximize risk-adjusted returns using the Markowitz Mean-Variance Optimization approach. The model leverages financial metrics like Sharpe Ratio and Volatility for feature engineering and validates portfolio performance through historical data analysis.

The project is implemented in Python and uses key libraries such as SciPy, pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib, with data fetched via the Yahoo Finance API.

#Features
-Financial Data Analysis:
i. Fetch historical stock data using Yahoo Finance API.
ii. Calculate financial metrics including Sharpe Ratio, Volatility, and Covariance Matrix.

-Portfolio Optimization:
Implement Markowitz Mean-Variance Optimization using SciPy to determine the optimal allocation of assets.

-Backtesting and Validation:
i. Evaluate portfolio performance using historical data and compare with a baseline (equal-weight portfolio).
ii. Visualize cumulative returns and optimized portfolio allocation.

-Baseline Comparison:
Compare optimized portfolio metrics (return, volatility, Sharpe Ratio) against an equal-weight benchmark.
